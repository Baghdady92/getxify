## 4.0.0

This release resolves **111 issues reported on the upstream GetX issue tracker** ([jonataslaw/getx](https://github.com/jonataslaw/getx)) that were verified against this codebase. Every fix ships with regression tests; the test suite grew from 144 to 494 tests.

### Behavior Changes

- **`Get.back` returns `bool`** - so callers can detect when the back navigation was ignored because there was no route to go back to; source-compatible for callers ignoring the result (getx#2474)
- **The iOS back-swipe starts only near the leading edge by default** - matching native iOS, so it no longer hijacks horizontal gestures like sliders and carousels; `popGesture: true` keeps the historical full-screen area and `gestureWidth: (_) => double.infinity` restores it explicitly (getx#3209)
- **Middleware lifecycle callbacks run once, on the declaring page's route** - (`onPageBuilt`, `onPageDispose`, ...) instead of once per page in the nested stack; navigation guards (`redirect`/`redirectDelegate`/`onPageCalled`) remain inherited by child pages, and nested flattening no longer registers duplicate routes (getx#3170)
- **`Get.reloadAll()` calls `onDelete`/`onClose` before clearing instances** - and skips `GetxService`s unless `force: true`, matching `Get.reload<S>()` (getx#2397)
- **Inherited bindings execute parents-first** - and a parent `GetPage`'s `binding` now runs when the initial route is one of its child pages (getx#2085)

### System Back & Pop Behavior

- **System back / predictive back respects `PopScope`, `WillPopScope` and `GetPage.canPop`** - `GetDelegate.popRoute` consults the route's pop disposition like `NavigatorState.maybePop`, and a blocked pop reports `onPopInvoked` with `didPop: false` (getx#3216, getx#2996, getx#2704, getx#2869, getx#2434, getx#2188)
- **Browser back on Flutter Web respects pop vetoes** - single-page back navigations consult `PopScope`/`WillPopScope`/`canPop` before popping, and the target entry is re-located by identity after the async veto check so a `willPop` callback that navigates cannot make the wrong pages pop (getx#3121)
- **Browser back with an open dialog/bottom sheet closes the overlay** - instead of popping the underlying page (getx#3322)
- **`Get.back()`/`Get.close()` close open Scaffold drawers** - and other local-history entries such as persistent bottom sheets, without popping the page (getx#3227, getx#2717)
- **Back navigation over imperatively pushed routes works** - `Get.back()`, the system back button/gesture, and the iOS edge-swipe pop pageless routes (e.g. `OpenContainer`, raw `Navigator.push`) through the Navigator instead of removing the underlying page from the router delegate's history, which previously tore down two screens at once (getx#3436)
- **Pops through the router delegate play the pop animation** - when a pop surfaces to a navigator as a page replacement (the norm inside `GetRouterOutlet`), the new pop-aware `GetTransitionDelegate` (default for the root and outlet navigators; a user-supplied `transitionDelegate` still wins) animates the leaving route in reverse on top of the revealed page; a `PopMode.page` pop of the only history entry now replaces it with the parent branch instead of pushing the parent on top of the leaf (getx#1883)

### Navigation & Routing

- **Fixed `preventDuplicates` being ignored in Navigator 2.0** - `GetPage.copyWith` no longer drops `preventDuplicateHandlingMode`, `preventDuplicates: false` on `Get.to`/`Get.toNamed`/`GetPage` pushes duplicates again, and `popUntilOriginalRoute` pops back to (not past) the original route (getx#3261, getx#3251, getx#2975, getx#3054)
- **`Get.arguments`/`Get.parameters` are scoped to the building page** - pages pushed in the same action no longer see each other's arguments (getx#2286)
- **Fixed `Get.to` with different closures returning the same widget type** - navigation no longer silently re-shows the old page (getx#2161)
- **Fixed tear-off route names** - `Get.to(MyPage.new)` no longer generates names polluted with the parameter list (getx#2245)
- **`initialRoute` is honored when a `/` page is registered** - the app starts on `initialRoute` and `/` stays reachable (getx#3196)
- **A stopped initial route no longer leaves a blank screen** - the delegate falls back to the not-found page when middleware nullifies the first navigation or a deep link (getx#2949)
- **Fixed `unknownRoute` never being shown when a root `/` page is registered** - `ParseRouteTree.matchRoute` no longer treats a partial ancestor match as a full match (getx#3352)
- **Fixed null-check crash in `PageRedirect.getPageToRoute`** - navigating to an unmatched route with no `unknownRoute` configured degrades gracefully to the delegate's not-found page (getx#3367)
- **Fixed `offAllNamed` to the surviving bottom route keeping stale content** - the page is rebuilt and its bindings/controllers recreated (getx#2899)
- **Fixed routing-state corruption** - `GetObserver.didPop` no longer sets `Routing.previous` equal to `Routing.current` (which also broke the `preventDuplicates` check in `Get.off`), dismissing stacked dialogs/sheets no longer leaves synthetic `DIALOG/BOTTOMSHEET <hash>` names in `Get.currentRoute`/`Get.previousRoute`, and `Get.rawRoute` no longer becomes null after `Get.offAllNamed` (getx#3394, getx#2597, getx#2334, getx#1237)
- **Fixed `Get.key` throwing "GetRoot is not part of the tree" before the app mounts** - `GetMaterialApp(navigatorKey: Get.key)` works (getx#3323)
- **Fixed theme changes being ignored when `GetMaterialApp` is rebuilt by a parent** - `GetRootState` reconciles updated `ConfigData` (theme, darkTheme, themeMode, locale, ...) in `didUpdateWidget`, so wrapping `GetMaterialApp` in `Obx` works (getx#3371)
- **`GetMaterialApp` renders its initial route on the first pump in widget tests** - no extra `pumpAndSettle` needed (getx#3244)
- **`shortcuts` parameter type matches `MaterialApp`** - now `Map<ShortcutActivator, Intent>?`, accepting `SingleActivator`/`CharacterActivator` (getx#2615)
- **Added `restorationScopeId` to `GetMaterialApp`/`GetCupertinoApp`** - including the `.router` constructors, enabling app-level state restoration (getx#2144)
- **Descriptive `GetPage` name assert** - states the offending name and the leading-slash requirement (getx#2564)

### Flutter Web

- **Replace-style navigations are reported as history replacements** - `Get.off`/`Get.offAll`/`Get.offAllNamed` use the new default `GetRouteInformationProvider`, and browser back/forward to a route already on the stack pops back to it instead of resurrecting removed pages; duplicate same-name entries and same-frame replace-then-push sequences are reported correctly (getx#3372)
- **Fixed the initial URL report pushing an extra history entry** - which activated the browser back button on a plain page load (getx#3266)
- **The URL strategy is applied once per process** - no more "Cannot set URL strategy a second time" crashes (getx#3224)

### Middleware

- **v4-style `GetMiddleware.redirect()` is honored again** - in all named navigation, with forwarded arguments; replace-style navigations (`off`/`offAll`/`offAllNamed`) run middleware, so `redirectDelegate` returning null stops them too (getx#2779, getx#2713, getx#2579, getx#2231)
- **Middlewares run in `priority` order and stop at the first redirect** (getx#1298)
- **`Get.parameters` reflects the in-flight route while middlewares run** - including parameters added by a redirect, hardened against overlapping navigations; redirect cycles settle on the not-found page instead of hanging navigation (getx#3139)
- **`onPageCalled` returning null cancels the page gracefully** - instead of a null-check crash (getx#2909)
- **Middleware redirects can forward navigation arguments** - `RouteDecoder.fromRoute` accepts an optional `arguments` parameter so `redirectDelegate` targets can access the original `Get.arguments` (getx#3408)
- **`GetRouterOutlet.initialRoute` runs the middleware pipeline** - synchronous results are honored during build, and asynchronous `redirectDelegate` results are resolved post-frame with change detection so stable decisions cannot rebuild in a loop (getx#1978)

### Nested Navigation & GetRouterOutlet

- **iOS swipe-back works between sibling routes inside `GetRouterOutlet`** - outlets stack the sibling pages of every history entry sharing their anchor (previous siblings stay mounted, retaining state), and imperative pops on the outlet navigator (back-swipe gesture, `Navigator.pop`, AppBar back) are reflected into the navigation history (getx#2107)
- **Nested shells stay mounted when unrelated root routes sit on top** - `participatesInRootNavigator` shells (with their navigators and controllers) survive sibling navigation, and pops restore the previously selected nested child (getx#3336, getx#2011)
- **Doubly nested `GetRouterOutlet`s work** - deeper outlets' pages no longer leak into the outer navigator, and outlets no longer fail the Navigator pages-API assertion (getx#3347, getx#2638)
- **Pages marked `participatesInRootNavigator` are no longer mounted twice** (getx#3111)
- **Fixed "Multiple widgets used the same GlobalKey" outlet crashes** - anchorless outlets no longer reuse the root navigator's key, and with duplicate same-anchor outlets the shared nested-delegate key attaches only to the most recently mounted one (getx#2742)
- **Hero animations fly exactly once** - removed `GetNavigator`'s duplicate `HeroController` (the framework scope owns it), gave nested outlets their own persistent `HeroControllerScope`, and back-gesture detectors disposed mid-drag no longer leave the navigator stuck in `userGestureInProgress` (getx#3350, getx#2931)
- **Deep links no longer take ownership of ancestor pages' controllers** - dependencies registered by bindings inherited from ancestor pages are linked to the declaring ancestor's route, so leaving a deep-linked leaf no longer disposes controllers the still-visible parent view depends on (getx#2183)

### Transitions & Gestures

- **Fixed frozen previous-page animation during route transitions** - `GetPageRouteTransitionMixin.canTransitionTo` accepts `MaterialRouteTransitionMixin` routes (mirroring Flutter's own implementation), so the outgoing page animates when a plain `MaterialPageRoute` is pushed over a `GetPageRoute` (getx#3452)
- **`Transition.native` honors the theme's `pageTransitionsTheme`** - e.g. `PredictiveBackPageTransitionsBuilder` (getx#2340)
- **`Get.defaultTransition` is no longer force-initialized from the fallback theme** - routes without an explicit transition follow the app theme on all platforms (getx#3274)
- **`gestureWidth` takes effect** - when set, the back-swipe only starts within that width from the leading edge (getx#3373)
- **Back-swipe direction fixed for `Transition.leftToRight`/`leftToRightWithFade`** - the page follows the finger toward the edge it entered from (getx#2193)
- **`Transition.downToUp` no longer reveals a black background** - the outgoing page stays in place, modal-style (getx#1560)
- **`Transition.circularReveal` radius is computed from the screen size** - fixing clipped corners on large screens such as iPad Pro 12.9 (getx#3130)
- **Added `Transition.predictiveBack`** - per-route Android predictive back without configuring `pageTransitionsTheme` (getx#3109)
- **Added `customTransition` to `Get.to`/`Get.off`/`Get.offAll`** - imperative navigation can use `CustomTransition` animations, previously only available via `GetPage` (getx#2475)
- **Added `GetPage.allowSnapshotting`** - disable route-transition snapshotting per page (getx#3282)
- **`transitionDuration` on `GetMaterialApp`/`GetCupertinoApp` is honored** - previously dead config (getx#2503)

### Dialogs, Bottom Sheets & Snackbars

- **Fixed `Get.close()` dropping its `result` and `id` arguments** - awaited `Get.bottomSheet`/`Get.dialog` futures complete with the provided result (getx#3319, getx#3387)
- **`Get.close`, `Get.closeDialog` and `Get.closeBottomSheet` close native overlays** - dialogs and sheets opened with Flutter's own `showDialog`/`showModalBottomSheet` are recognized by inspecting the navigator's top route (getx#3342)
- **Fixed `Get.closeOverlay()` popping page routes like `Get.back()`** - it closes the actual overlay when called right after an awaited navigation, and the router history no longer removes the wrong route (getx#3316)
- **Overlay status getters no longer throw before routing is initialized** - `Get.isOverlaysOpen`, `Get.isDialogOpen`, `Get.isBottomSheetOpen` and `Get.isSnackbarOpen` return `false`/`null` instead of throwing (getx#3370)
- **Overlays own their arguments and dependencies correctly** - `Get.arguments` returns the overlay's arguments while it is topmost (getx#2122), `Get.bottomSheet` gains `arguments`/`name` (getx#2005), and controllers `Get.put` while an overlay is open belong to the page beneath and survive the overlay's dismissal (getx#1969)
- **`Get.defaultDialog` renders its custom action** - `custom`, `textCustom` and `onCustom` were previously silently ignored (getx#1716, getx#3042, getx#1381)
- **Added `scrollable` and `canPop` parameters to `Get.defaultDialog`** - forward `AlertDialog.scrollable` for tall content, and block back-gesture dismissal (getx#3330, getx#3184)
- **Added `transitionBuilder` to `Get.dialog`** - custom dialog animations without dropping to `Get.generalDialog` (getx#3127)
- **`Get.showOverlay` always cleans up on error** - including non-`Exception` throws like Strings and Errors (getx#2827)
- **`Get.bottomSheet` works inside `GetCupertinoApp`** - falls back to `DefaultMaterialLocalizations` when no material delegates are installed (getx#2337)
- **Made `SnackbarController.close()` idempotent** - closing an already-dismissed snackbar no longer asserts, and `close(withAnimations: false)` cancels the pending duration timer (getx#3343)
- **Snackbar queue robustness** - closing a still-queued snackbar no longer crashes (getx#2761) or mounts broken overlay state later (getx#2257); `closeCurrentSnackbar`/`cancelAllSnackbars` (and the `Get.` wrappers) gain `withAnimations` (getx#2400)
- **Snackbar hit-testing and rendering** - the margin and the space beside width-constrained snackbars pass pointer events through while the bar stays tappable and swipe-dismissible (getx#3012, getx#2995), RTL icon paddings mirror correctly (getx#3069), and the left bar indicator respects `borderRadius` (getx#2747)

### Dependency Injection & Lifecycle

- **Fixed deferred route disposal destroying freshly created controllers** - when a route is popped and the same controller is re-registered before the old route finishes disposing (rapid back-and-forth navigation, re-push during exit transition, or `Get.offAllNamed` to a route reusing the same controller type), only the superseded instance is disposed and the live controller stays registered; superseded `GetxService`s in the pending chain are disposed instead of blocking deletion forever (getx#3446, getx#3315, getx#3351)
- **Fixed stale dirty flag on `fenix` registrations** - a `fenix` factory retained after deletion is no longer perpetually treated as stale, fixing missed `onClose` calls on resurrected controllers (getx#3292)
- **Fixed controllers being linked to the wrong route** - when multiple pages are pushed within the same frame, each route's bindings and lazily-created controllers link to their own route, so popping the top route no longer disposes them all (getx#3280)
- **Route disposal no longer deletes controllers a still-visible view depends on** - deletion of a route-linked instance that still has widget subscribers is deferred to end-of-frame; subscribers remaining after the disposed route's subtree unmounted keep the instance alive (getx#2404)
- **Controllers created inside native `showModalBottomSheet`/`showDialog` builders no longer leak** - they are released when the overlay is dismissed (getx#2439)
- **Restored `Get.putAsync` and added `Bind.putAsync`** - asynchronously-constructed dependencies register through `put()` with the full lifecycle (getx#3239)
- **`Get.replace`/`Get.lazyReplace` (and the `Bind` variants) really replace** - fenix registrations, `GetxService`s and pending disposal chains no longer resurrect the old builder (getx#2268)
- **Nullable generic registrations share the non-nullable registry key** - `Get.put<App?>(...)` is visible to `Get.find<App>()` (getx#2657)
- **`Get.reloadAll()` no longer throws `ConcurrentModificationError`** - when an instance's `onClose` mutates the registry

### State Management

- **`GetBuilder(global: false)` controllers receive `onClose` on unmount** - unless `autoRemove: false` (getx#2123)
- **Controllers survive tree-shape swaps** - a `LayoutBuilder` breakpoint change no longer deletes the controller the visible page is using; disposal defers to the last live subscriber (getx#2393)
- **`GetBuilder`/`Bind` rebinds when its `tag` changes on rebuild** - disposing an autoRemove controller created under the old tag instead of silently keeping the stale controller (getx#2232)
- **`GetBuilder`/`Bind` `initState` callbacks can access `state.controller`** - the callback runs after the controller is available (getx#2354)
- **Descriptive `BindError` on (type, tag) mismatch** - names the type and tag and how to fix it, instead of an opaque null-check crash (getx#2573)
- **Ticker providers follow `TickerMode`** - `GetSingleTickerProviderStateMixin`/`GetTickerProviderStateMixin` tickers are muted when the route is covered, unified behind a shared `GetTickerProvider` interface (getx#2426)

### Reactive Types

- **Fixed default-constructed `RxList`/`RxSet`/`RxMap` being unusable** - the default constructors previously backed the collection with an immutable `Never`-typed const literal, so the first `add()`/`[]=` threw a `TypeError`; they now create properly typed growable collections (getx#3411)
- **`assign`/`assignAll` no longer require a growable backing collection** - collections created from fixed-length or unmodifiable sources (e.g. `List.empty().obs`, `const [].obs`, `Set.unmodifiable(...).obs`) previously crashed with "Cannot clear a fixed-length list"; the backing is replaced with a fresh mutable copy preserving its runtime element type, and the collection is fully mutable afterwards
- **`assign`/`assignAll` notify exactly once** - `RxSet` and `RxMap` no longer emit an intermediate empty event or a redundant second notification (getx#2250)
- **`bindStream` no longer leaks subscriptions** - it returns its `StreamSubscription`, supports `cancelPrevious: true`, and cancels all bindings when the Rx closes (getx#3000)

### Internationalization & Platform

- **Fixed translation lookup ignoring `Locale.scriptCode`** - `tr` resolves keys in specificity order (`lang_script_country` > `lang_script` > `lang_country` > `lang` > similar-language) for both `Get.locale` and `Get.fallbackLocale`, so `Locale('zh', scriptCode: 'Hant')` no longer resolves to `zh_CN` (getx#3380)
- **Fixed device-locale changes overriding an explicitly set app locale** - the device locale is only followed when the app never set one via `GetMaterialApp(locale:)` or `Get.updateLocale`, which now records explicit intent (getx#3357)
- **CLDR plural-category support** - new `PluralCase` enum, pluggable `Get.pluralResolver`, and `trPluralCases`/`trPluralCasesParams` let apps supply correct plural forms for languages like Arabic and Russian; `trPlural`/`trPluralParams` behavior is unchanged (getx#1855)
- **Documented `trParams` placeholder ordering for RTL translations** - with regression tests (getx#3073)
- **`GetPlatform.isMacOS` works on Firefox for macOS** - and iPad/iPod `navigator.platform` values are detected correctly (getx#1936)

### Animations

- **`BlurAnimation` blurs its child, not the backdrop** - and `GetAnimatedBuilder` honors updated `duration`/`tween`/`curve` on rebuild, owning and disposing its `CurvedAnimation` across updates and unmount (getx#3233)
- **Added `autoPlayOnUpdate` to `GetAnimatedBuilder` and all animation extensions** - when enabled, the animation replays from the beginning whenever the widget is rebuilt with a different tween, enabling declarative replays driven by Obx state (getx#2760)

### Internal Improvements

- **Renamed `rx_ticket_provider_mixin.dart` to `rx_ticker_provider_mixin.dart`** - fixing the long-standing file name typo (getx#2801)
- **Refactors** - the bottom-sheet `MaterialLocalizations` fallback moved into `GetModalBottomSheetRoute.buildPage` (also fixing direct route users under Cupertino apps); overlay close loops resolve the navigator's top route once per iteration and `Get.close()` evaluates its predicates lazily; centralized routing-initialization guards; removed dead code

## 3.0.0

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Restructured navigation routes** - Reorganized the flat `lib/get_navigation/src/routes/` directory into three structured subdirectories (`transitions/`, `router/`, and `core/`) to improve codebase organization and readability.

- **Refactored naming conventions** - Renamed the legacy truncated private map `_singl` to `_singletons` and the `Inst` extension to `GetInstanceExt` in `extension_instance.dart`. Renamed the `RxTnew` extension to `RxTNew` in `rx_impl.dart` to adhere to Dart's UpperCamelCase style guidelines.

- **Fixed parameter naming in RxList** - Corrected parameter names in `fillRange` and `replaceRange` methods to match the overridden method signatures from Dart's List interface (changed `fillValue` to `fill` and `replacement` to `newContents`)

- **Enhanced RxSet factory constructors** - Added missing factory constructors (`from`, `of`, `unmodifiable`, `identity`) to match Dart's Set API and provide complete factory constructor coverage

- **Enhanced RxMap factory constructors** - Added missing factory constructors (`fromIterable`, `fromIterables`, `fromEntries`) to match Dart's Map API and provide complete factory constructor coverage

- **Fixed null safety in RxnString** - Removed `Comparable<String>` and `Pattern` interfaces from `RxnString` class as they don't make sense for nullable String types and were using forced null unwrap which could cause runtime exceptions

- **Maintained backward compatibility** - Kept both `.obs` extension methods (getter-style and method-style) to ensure compatibility with existing code while supporting Dart 3 features

- **Cleaned up navigation extensions** - Removed unrelated UI, layout, and media query properties (such as `pixelRatio`, `width`, `height`, `statusBarHeight`, `bottomBarHeight`, `textScaleFactor`, `textTheme`, `mediaQuery`, `isDarkMode`, `isPlatformDarkMode`, `iconColor`, `focusScope`) from `extension_navigation.dart` to keep the navigation module focused solely on routing and state features.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed parameter name mismatch warnings** - Resolved analyzer warnings about parameter names not matching overridden method signatures in RxList

- **Fixed overlay closure logic** - Fixed a logical bug in `closeAllDialogsAndBottomSheets` where it incorrectly required *both* a dialog and a bottom sheet to be open simultaneously to close them (changed the condition check from `&&` to `||`).

---

## 2.0.2

### Refactoring & Code Quality

- **Cleaned up `get_rx` bloat** - Removed over 1,000 lines of redundant, unrelated proxy helper methods from `RxNum`, `RxInt`, `RxDouble`, and `RxString` extensions, aligning the reactive wrappers with the core project scope. Core basic mathematical, relational, and bitwise operators were retained.
- **Enhanced Documentation** - Added comprehensive Dart documentation comments and examples to public classes, extensions, methods, and callbacks across `get_instance`, `get_core`, `get_animations`, `get_common`, and `get_rx` modules.
- **Removed comment/code boilerplate** - Cleaned up commented-out methods, legacy variables, and dead code references across the entire codebase.

### Performance Optimizations

- **Optimized `RxList`, `RxMap`, and `RxSet`** - Overrode batch-mutating collection methods (such as `clear()`, `removeAt()`, `addAll()`, `removeWhere()`, etc.) to directly mutate the underlying standard Dart collections and trigger exactly one reactive refresh notification. This prevents multiple redundant widget rebuild cycles.

### Bug Fixes

- **Corrected doc comment typos** - Fixed possessive "it's" typos, brackets in generics `[find]<[S]>()`, and incorrect method references (`Get.[create]`) in documentation.

---

## 2.0.1

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed RxnDouble subtraction operator** - The subtraction operator in `RxnDoubleExt` was incorrectly using addition instead of subtraction, now properly subtracts the given value.
- **Fixed ListExtension assign methods** - Added `clear()` call for non-RxList cases in both `assign()` and `assignAll()` methods to ensure proper list clearing before adding new items.
- **Fixed null safety in navigation extensions** - Replaced unsafe null assertion operators (`!`) with null-aware operators (`?? false`) for `isDialogOpen` and `isBottomSheetOpen` checks in `extension_navigation.dart` to prevent null pointer exceptions.
- **Fixed GetPage copyWith restorationId** - Fixed bug where `restorationId` parameter was being compared with itself instead of `this.restorationId` in the `copyWith` method.
- **Fixed ColorAnimation color filter** - Simplified ColorAnimation to use the animated value directly instead of incorrectly interpolating with Color.lerp, which was causing incorrect color filtering behavior.
- **Fixed dependency deletion logic** - Improved dependency cleanup in `extension_instance.dart` with recursive factory cleanup for `lateRemove` dependencies and proper fenix mode handling.
- **Fixed isDesktop context extension** - Fixed `isDesktop` getter to correctly reference `isDesktopOrWider` instead of `isDesktopOrLess`, ensuring proper desktop breakpoint detection.

---

## 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed GetUtils class** - The `GetUtils` class with 722 lines of validation and string manipulation methods has been removed. This includes:
  - Validation methods: `isEmail`, `isURL`, `isPhoneNumber`, `isDateTime`, `isMD5`, `isSHA1`, `isSHA256`, `isSSN`, `isBinary`, `isIPv4`, `isIPv6`, `isHexadecimal`, `isPalindrome`, `isUsername`, `isCurrency`, `isPassport`, Brazilian `isCpf`/`isCnpj`
  - File type checks: `isVideo`, `isImage`, `isAudio`, `isPPT`, `isWord`, `isExcel`, `isAPK`, `isPDF`, `isTxt`, `isChm`, `isVector`, `isHTML`
  - String manipulation: `capitalize`, `capitalizeFirst`, `removeAllWhitespace`, `camelCase`, `snakeCase`, `paramCase`, `numericOnly`, `capitalizeAllWordsFirstLetter`
  - Length validation methods
  - Basic type checks: `isNull`, `isNullOrBlank`, `isBlank`, `isNum`, `isNumericOnly`, `isAlphabetOnly`, `hasCapitalLetter`, `isBool`

- **Removed string extensions** - All string extensions that wrapped GetUtils methods have been removed:
  - `isNum`, `isNumericOnly`, `isAlphabetOnly`, `isBool`
  - `isVectorFileName`, `isImageFileName`, `isAudioFileName`, `isVideoFileName`, `isTxtFileName`, `isDocumentFileName`, `isExcelFileName`, `isPPTFileName`, `isAPKFileName`, `isPDFFileName`, `isHTMLFileName`
  - `isURL`, `isEmail`, `isPhoneNumber`, `isDateTime`
  - `capitalize`, `capitalizeFirst`, `removeAllWhitespace`, `camelCase`, `paramCase`, `numericOnly`, `capitalizeAllWordsFirstLetter`

- **Removed unused extensions** - The following extension modules have been removed:
  - `double_extensions.dart`
  - `duration_extensions.dart`
  - `dynamic_extensions.dart`
  - `int_extensions.dart`
  - `num_extensions.dart`
  - `widget_extensions.dart`

- **Removed GetMicrotask class** - The `GetMicrotask` class has been removed as it was not used anywhere in the codebase.

- **Removed OptimizedListView widget** - The `OptimizedListView` widget has been removed as it was not used anywhere in the codebase.

### Migration Guide

If you were using any of the removed utilities, you should migrate to dedicated packages:

- **Validation**: Use the [`validator`](https://pub.dev/packages/validator) package or similar
- **String manipulation**: Use the [`recase`](https://pub.dev/packages/recase) package for case conversion
- **File operations**: Use the [`path`](https://pub.dev/packages/path) package
- **Equality**: Use the [`equatable`](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) package if you need value-based equality in your own code

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed controller disposal during rapid navigation** - Controllers are now properly disposed when quickly navigating back and forth using keyboard shortcuts or programmatic navigation. Added `reportRouteWillDispose` call in the `didPop` method of `GetObserver` to ensure dependencies are cleaned up correctly.
- **Fixed secondary animation issue** - Outgoing pages now animate correctly when using `Navigator.push` with `GetMaterialApp` or `GetCupertinoApp`. The apps now use regular `MaterialApp`/`CupertinoApp` when `getPages` is null and no router config is provided, allowing proper secondary animations for imperative navigation.
- **Fixed null routerDelegate handling** - `GetRoot` now properly handles cases where `routerDelegate` is null, preventing runtime errors when accessing navigation keys in non-router scenarios.

### Improvements

- **Reduced bundle size** - Removed ~1000+ lines of unnecessary utility code
- **Focused scope** - GetXify now focuses on its core purpose: state management, navigation, and dependency injection
- **Better separation of concerns** - General-purpose utilities should use dedicated packages, not a framework

### Kept Functionality

The following essential utilities remain:

- `Equality` mixin - Needed by `StateMixin` for value-based equality comparison
- `GetPlatform` - Platform detection (used in 3 places in core framework)
- `GetQueue` - Queue management (used by snackbar system)
- `IterableExtensions` - `mapMany`, `firstWhereOrNull` (used by router)
- `ContextExtensions` - `theme`, `mediaQuery`, `height`, `width` (used by responsive design and navigation)
- `InternationalizationExtensions` - `.tr` extension for translations
- `EventLoopExtensions` - `asap`, `toEnd` methods (used by core framework)
- `printInfo` method - Added to `GetInterface` for logging
